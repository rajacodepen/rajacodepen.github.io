 # Why Documentation
## Yes here it is
 Improving the documentation is a dream of every developer. Who says know, if someone says am going to present your work
    to the world in a better way which is more relevant and clear to the audience.

Boss says, the product needs to have good documentation. As usual.. thinks just buying a tool will solve the problem.
As if, the team knows the documentation strategies, types of documents to create.

Obviously, there is no shortcut, one should understand the concept first and then the tools.
Commit to maintain something. Prevent from being obsolete.

Documentation is not a rocket science, in many situations no need to build a special competancy for that.

Familiarize yourself with both the Descriptive, Conversational, Comparative style of writing.

You may say, I can just do it in any word editor.. to some extent yes.. but soon if you soon realize am getting
distracted by the formatting needs and unable to concentrate on my story.. then you need to understand a little
bit about the Markdown language. Not to master it. But to know, how it can ease the pain.


Documentation techniques will guide you, how to plan the content
Tools will help you, on how to present the content.

Whether it is an email, resume, story or a document the core skill is being narrative.
